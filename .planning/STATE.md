# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** A user can record/upload a lift and get trustworthy, plain-language form-error feedback grounded in a published dataset and method.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Dataset Consolidation & EDA

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Squat Data Pipeline & Colab Harness) — planned, ready to execute
Plan: 0 of 1 in current phase (16 tasks)
Status: Phase 2 planned (02-CONTEXT, 02-RESEARCH, 02-01-PLAN, 02-01-PLAN-REVIEW all in place; PLAN-CHECKER verdict PASS on iteration 2)
Last activity: 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 planning complete; 16-task plan covering PyTorch loaders + resumable Colab harness + 2-epoch tiny smoke + bitwise-resume proof; full subagent loop used (researcher → planner → plan-checker × 2). Execution is interactive cell-by-cell per the working agreement.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Rebuild form-correction on Fitness-AQA; scrap the v4–v7 / QEVD line
- Init: Squat-first vertical slice; supervised baseline before domain-knowledge SSL
- Init: Binary detection + timing feedback; PyTorch for the form model
- Phase 1: Use the Drive shortcut in place (verified, 8/8 archives readable) — no preprocessing of Drive layout; copy zip → local per Colab session for training
- Phase 1: Joint multi-label head over a shared backbone for Squat (KIE & KFE co-occur — 192 of 232 KIE+ also KFE+)
- Phase 1: Notebook artifacts as `.py` jupytext-percent format (git-friendly; converts to .ipynb when needed)
- Phase 1: OHP barbell-trajectory preprocessing deferred to Phase 6 (track-0 default + NaN interpolation)
- Phase 2 (research override): input crop is 112×112 (torchvision R2Plus1D_18 Kinetics-V1 native), not the paper's 320→224 (which was the Waseda 2DCNN path). `crop_size` parameterized for Phase 3 ablation
- Phase 2 (research override): `Code_Release/motion_disentanglement/` is empty (1-byte README) — no supervised baseline code shipped. Phase 2 Task 1–2 clone the repo and document the gap; pipeline reconstructed from paper text + CVCSPC idioms
- Phase 2 (research override): decoder wrapped behind `decode_clip(path, indices)` — `torchvision.io.read_video` for now, one-line swap target for TorchCodec when Colab's torchvision passes 0.22
- Phase 2 (research override): horizontal flip default OFF (paper line 576 lists augmentations without flip; CVCSPC has it commented out)
- Phase 2 (research override): multi-label imbalance handled via `BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=Tensor([w_KIE, w_KFE]))`, not `WeightedRandomSampler`; dataset exposes `pos_weight`, Phase 3 consumes
- Phase 2: atomic Drive checkpoint write (tmp + torch.load round-trip verify + os.replace + latest.txt last) — Drive FUSE rename is not atomic
