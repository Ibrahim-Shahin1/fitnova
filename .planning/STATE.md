# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** A user can record/upload a lift and get trustworthy, plain-language form-error feedback grounded in a published dataset and method.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Dataset Consolidation & EDA

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (Squat Supervised Baseline) — ready to plan
Plan: 1 of 1 complete in Phase 2 (16 tasks all green)
Status: Phase 2 closed; Phase 3 ready
Last activity: 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 closed. PyTorch loader stack + resumable Colab harness + decoded-batch supervisor viz + bitwise-resume proof all shipped. Tasks 1–14 each got an atomic commit (feat/fix/chore(02)). Tasks 15–16 closed Phase 2 via human-verify gate + summary. Resumed-epoch-1 batch losses are byte-identical to baseline-epoch-1 batch losses → RNG capture/restore is functionally correct, not just structurally present. Phase 3 starts heavy training (hours per run) → fresh Colab notebook + L4 GPU before kickoff (see memory: feedback_heavy_training_new_notebook).

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Rebuild form-correction on Fitness-AQA; scrap the v4–v7 / QEVD line
- Init: Squat-first vertical slice; supervised baseline before domain-knowledge SSL
- Init: Binary detection + timing feedback; PyTorch for the form model
- Phase 1: Use the Drive shortcut in place (verified, 8/8 archives readable) — no preprocessing of Drive layout; copy zip → local per Colab session for training
- Phase 1: Joint multi-label head over a shared backbone for Squat (KIE & KFE co-occur — 192 of 232 KIE+ also KFE+)
- Phase 1: Notebook artifacts as `.py` jupytext-percent format (git-friendly; converts to .ipynb when needed)
- Phase 1: OHP barbell-trajectory preprocessing deferred to Phase 6 (track-0 default + NaN interpolation)
- Phase 2 (research override): input crop is 112×112 (torchvision R2Plus1D_18 Kinetics-V1 native), not the paper's 320→224 (which was the Waseda 2DCNN path). `crop_size` parameterized for Phase 3 ablation
- Phase 2 (research override): `Code_Release/motion_disentanglement/` is empty (1-byte README) — no supervised baseline code shipped. Phase 2 Task 1–2 clone the repo and document the gap; pipeline reconstructed from paper text + CVCSPC idioms
- Phase 2 (research override): decoder wrapped behind `decode_clip(path, indices)` — `torchvision.io.read_video` for now, one-line swap target for TorchCodec when Colab's torchvision passes 0.22
- Phase 2 (research override): horizontal flip default OFF (paper line 576 lists augmentations without flip; CVCSPC has it commented out)
- Phase 2 (research override): multi-label imbalance handled via `BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=Tensor([w_KIE, w_KFE]))`, not `WeightedRandomSampler`; dataset exposes `pos_weight`, Phase 3 consumes
- Phase 2: atomic Drive checkpoint write (tmp + torch.load round-trip verify + os.replace + latest.txt last) — Drive FUSE rename is not atomic
- Phase 2 (deviation): dataset uses torch's default RNG (not per-instance generator) so capture_rng_state/restore_rng_state cover sampling state across resume; per-instance generator would have broken Task 14's bitwise assertion
- Phase 2 (deviation): IPython kept at google.colab's pinned 7.34.0; autoreload enabled via a 4-line `imp` shim (`types.ModuleType` with `importlib.reload`) on Python 3.12
- Phase 2 (deviation): F11 windowing test corrected to clustered indices `[100, 102, 104]` (full-span indices defeat windowing — original plan had `[0, 200, 403]`)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-20
Stopped at: Phase 2 closed. Bitwise-resume proof landed (Tasks 12-14); both supervisor figures human-verified (Task 15); summary committed (Task 16). Recommend fresh chat + fresh Colab notebook on L4 GPU for Phase 3 — clean GSD boundary and heavy-training-fresh-notebook rule.
